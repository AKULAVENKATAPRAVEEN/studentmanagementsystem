This is simple student management system project by using shell scripting. By this project or program we can automate the manual track of student management. For example studnts enrollment, teacher assign, multiple teacher marks update, etc. By this program we can do that easily. Because of using the CSV file as the database we woulden't loose any data and we can perform operation realtime.

This project is for those we are excited and learning shell scripting and want to automate a simple and robust project. You and clone/fork this project and update it. Yes!! there is lots of places where I made mistakes and because of the time I wouden't correct them. Couse I need to submit the project.

In this project we have three acting users:

    Admin
    Teachers
    Students

Admin Admin has the conrol over the whole program. To loginto the admin the password id admin123. Admin can:

    Create Teachers
    Create Students
    Delete Students
    Create Semester
    Create Course
    Assign Teacher into the Course
    Enroll Students into the Course
    Modify assign Teacher
    View all action and data

Teacher Teacher is a restricted actor then the admin. A teacher only can update marks and view those students which specific course the teacher is assigned by the admin.

Student Student is fully restricted actor. A studnets only can view his marks.
